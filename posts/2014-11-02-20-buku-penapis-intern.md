Eric: Okay. Cool. What's one hiring tactic, or process, or trick, whatever you want to call it, that you can share with the audience? Because you've been doing this since you were 12 years old.

Emerson: Let me think. Hiring in particular. One thing that has worked out well in hiring so far has been, I have a tendency to run for certain types of product positions where they need to think very similar to I do, because I'm a very heavy product focused CEO. I've run all these guys through this gauntlet. They tend to come out of school, they don't have a ton of experience, they're hungry, they're super smart, and I'll have them—if they're interested in working for us—this is known as being one of the best places to work if you're an inspiring growth hacker or an internet marketer, or product person, etc.—I'll have them read twenty books on the topics of neuroscience, behavioral science, things of that nature; persuasion, negotiation, things like that. I do that to see if they're a hustler. I do that because it's super valuable information that's just valuable for them to know period and they'll be better at their jobs if I do hire them at the end of that.

Eric: Okay. And how long does this gauntlet, how many days, is there a deadline or anything?

Emerson: I usually pick the deadline depending on how much time I think that person will realistically to be able to accomplish it. If they're fresh out of school and they have no other commitments then it will be a short deadline more like twenty-five days or so, maybe 30 days. But if they're already working a full-time job I'll obviously be understanding of that fact.

Eric: So, if they're working a full time job, give or take 60, 70 days?

Emerson: Yeah, maybe more like 45.

Eric: 45. Yeah man that's rough. Tough gauntlet right there. We can talk about this

Emerson: So far I have a 100% hit rate though doing that. Everyone who has gone through that gauntlet is has proven to be an effective hire.

Eric: What's the retention rate on that?

Emerson: On the team members?

Eric: Yeah. Let's say they get through the gauntlet, what—

Emerson: 100%
